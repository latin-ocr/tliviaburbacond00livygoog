LIVY'S STYLE 1 1

altogether away from the sound love of noble subject-matter
and noble words equally matched together. The reader may
observe certain features of Livy's style with interest, and con·
sider how far they make towards the end he had in view. He
introduces variety, where the continual repetition of a fixed
phrase, however rigorously exact, would grow wearisome: it is
instructive to observe, e. g., how deftly he rings the changes
on cum and ubi and ablative absolutes, Not unconnected with
this is the practice of using occasionally, archaia· or poetica!
turns of expression: e. g. mox of events in the past 27 ξ 133
the order of namque 25 § 23 the word fatalis 5 ξ 11 3 et for
etiam 2 ξ 4 3 adversa montium 3 ἓ 1 3 adde quod 19 § 6 3 tem-
pestas :tempus 7 ξ 15. It is hard to say whether a similar
motive occasioned another peculiarity—the imitation of Greek
syntactical constructions, or whether such constructions were
becoming habitual in the spoken language: e. g. the omission
of the subject with an infinitive 1 § 11 3 the use of participles
4 §9‚ 6 ξ 12 3 the frequentative optative 6 ξ 2 3 future participles
to express purpose and to condense a relative clause 5 ξ 11 3
and an imitation of such constructions as οἱ νῦν 2 ξ 7, 7 ξ 8,
and of the uses of οὐδέ 7 § 14. More vital to the style is the
imagination continually at play to call up the past vividly and
the skill with which the language is then pressed into service
to paint what the imagination has seen. It is here that Livy,
is perhaps best to be seen at work, not content with the word
which, though it describes a thing, does not make it burn
before the reader's mind, and carefully selecting some word
whose novelty will surprise attention and make the matter live.
To appreciate the merits of Livy's style in this respect the
exact value to a Roman of his metaphorical words must be
gauged‚ and in the notes attention has often been called to
this. With the same object Livy constantly arranges his words
in an order that will guide his readers instantly to the sense.
