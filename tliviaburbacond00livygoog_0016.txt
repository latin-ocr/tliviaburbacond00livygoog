1 2 INTRODUCTION

the finest‚ declared that he found in Livy's Latin a certain
Patavinity. Wherein this provincialism lay it is beyond
modern power to tell, but one or two points in Livy’s grammar
deserve notice which are not of the same character as the
imitations just mentioned of Greek or of the poetical.

1. For the future infinitive he keeps near to the ancient
indeclinable form to this extent that he never adds esse. Cicero
inserts and omits esse with equal readiness

2. He extends to the nominative case (which Cicero does
not do) the use of a participle and noun in agreement equiva-
lent practically in sense to an abstract noun : e. g. 13 ξ 8.

3. Etiam in Livy sometimes precedeS‚ sometimes follows
what it emphasizeS. In Cicero it seems always to precede.

4. His syntax in oratio obliqua does not entirely conform
to the rules deduced by grammarians from Ciceronian usage:
e·g·1§4‚2§5‚6§13·

But it is seldom that Livy changes his construction in passing
from one to another of two parallel wordS, phrases or clauseS,
as the later Latin authors delight to do. Examples are to be
found, however, in 33 ξ 5 (in vulgus quam optimo cuique
gratiorem), in 6 ξ 4 incerti. . . et quod . . . and § 11.

The young student should notice that Livy uses mensum (not
mensium) 33 § 6 and 43 ξ 21, praestaturus (not praestiturus)
-24 ξ 4 ‚- that his employment of plerique (6 ξ 2) and cunctus
(6 ξ 7) is like that of the Silver Age writers3 and (a) he uses
asyndeton freely, to give point or opposition (see notes on
1 ξ 1); (b) he omits est continually 3 e. g. in 5 ξ 5, 20 § 9 3

(c) and sometimes omits the subject 3 e. g. in 1 ξ 11 (cf. 35 § 5).
These three means make for conciseneSS, another of the

virtues in Livy's style. The total effect of that style has been
summed up by Quintilian in the words mira iucunditas clartlssi-
musque candor (⁴ a wonderful charm and distinction ⁷).
