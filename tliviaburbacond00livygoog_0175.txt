‘We extend a hearty welcome to this new series, which is assured
os success if the future authors to be included in it find editors with
the powers os lucid exposition and understanding of boys’ needs which
are possessed by Mr. Freeman. The introductione are admirably
adapted for young readers, and Mr. Freeman is to be heartily
congratulated upon what he has achieved‚ both in these and in the
notes, and it is all done simply by taking to heart the old inJunction
os Marcus Aurelius, ἅπλωσον σεαυτόν 1 ’— The School lVorld.

(Of Horace, Sele-ct Odes) ‘This delightful edition . . . It would be
absurd to deny that the selection has been made with great discri-
mination. The notes are simplicity itself, and deserve the attention
os all teaehers of the subject. The introduction, too, is all that is
required, as well as the brief, but clear, explanation os Horatian metreS.
We heartily congratulate Mr. J ackson on his success as an editor and
commentator.’—Secondary Education. Α
