‘ The accidence is ·. . . as brief as
is compatible with an adequate
treatment of regular forms, all
irregularities being reserved so
sar as possible, sor an appendix.
An admirable, and m many of its
details an original, treatment of
the principal parts of verbs has
been adopted. . . . An immense
gain in simplicity and clearness
is due to Prof. Sonnenschein’s
method of treating'the Subiunc-
tive. . . . Prot'. Sonnenschein is
to be congratulated heartily upon
a book which marks so distinct
an advance in the teaching of
Latin grammar.’—-R. M. HENRY.
