AB VRBE CONDITA LIB. lx. 9

without a preposition aster a verb of motion. saneta agrees

with the nearer noun ; cf. 8 ξ 5. ·
§ 5. an: i. e. if you dispute that rule (that nothing can bind the

nation which the nation has not sanctioned). expresserunt
nobis: together. coegissent . . . diceretis: the difference
in tense must be observed; cf. 8 ξ 15. templa, delubra:

the former are sacred spaceS‚ whether those selected in the
heavens by the augurs for taking auspice3‚ or those permanently
marked out on earth (and often built upon) for the worship of the
gods; the latter are places of purification, where religious impurity
was washed away (de÷lavo).

ξ 6. quid tandem: se. diceretis. N otice the sense of tandem

with an interrogative. relicturum: without esse3 cf. 4 ξ 3.
meliora: se. duint or dent. inquis: sor the imaginary
second person cf. 1 ξ 7. ,

§ 7. rerum, ‘ the conditions ’ς cf. 6 ξ 2. illud: as osten,

preparing the way for a following clause. refert: perhaps in
origin = ‘it tends (fert) with interest (advantageous or disadvanta-
geous),’ where re will be an instrumental or sociative case (as in
ἀπώλετο ἡ ναῦς αὐτοῖς ἀνδράσι). It is always impersonal and is
followed only by an indirect question or, as here, by one in
ap osition to a neuter pronoun subject.

ξ 8. quibus . . . coegerunt: Latin rarely expresses a second
relative (as if here we had quz’); generally the proper part of is
is inserted3 here it is understood. English as a rule is more
logicglly regular in this matter, ‘ who were not satisfied . . . but com-
pelle .’

§9. neo . . . quaesiverit= et ne . . . quaes.; cf. 11 § 13.
This form of prohibition in the second person has a peremptory
tone, and is accordingly very rare ; but in Greek, where it is called
the aorist subjunctive, it is regular. quid = ‘ why ’. spopon-
derim: aorist subjunctive, its own tense unaffected, since quae-
siverit is a primary tense, yet perhaps makes esset historic, if esset
expresses a general rule. Possibly, like possem, it refers only to
the time of the compact. id: although belonging only to this
clause is thrown forward for emphasis before nec3 cf. 1 ξ 9.

§ 11. neo . . . et: nec does not connect probably3 cf. 4 ξ 8.
male partam, ‘ ill-got‚' though here little more than a cursing of
the event, is an echo of an old proverb, male parta male dilabuntur.
dum . . . eredunt: best got by an English present participle; cf.
3 ἕ 3. quacumque: used = quavis, while early Latin felt it
to be a relative requiring a relative clause aster it.

§ 12. an: cf. above, ξ 5. difficile fuit: strict syntax would
require suisset, but Livy here treats the phrase as in all Latin such
auxiliary verbs as possum were treated3 cf. 2§ 15. Latin, how-
ever, regularly followed logic in such phrase5‚ e. g. longum est
dicere = ‘it would be a long story ⁹. senest the pluial is
