· was ⁵.⁰. felt to express a single noun-idea that it could govern
a genitive.

ξ 10. saecula: not ‘centuries’ but ‘ generations ’,three of which
are reckoned to a century. From the founding of Rome in 75 3 to
the death of Alexander in 323 we have 430 yearS‚ practically
thirteen generations, '

§ 1 1. quin tu . . . confers: equivalent to an imperative; a lively
way of putting a protasis (si confers). Cf. 10 ξ 7. cum ho-
mine: this ‘ brachylogy of comparison ' (comparatio compendiaria)
is due to the same motive as has been noticed in §9 rebus. Cf.

ξ 12. nominem = ‘ could I’ (if necessary). annalibus:
libri lintei kept in Juno Moneta’s temple on the Capitol, giving

triumphS‚ and the like. consulum dictatorumque: not in
apposition to magistratuum, but with paginas = ‘ whole pages of ’,
‘ pages full of the names of.'

est: for the impersonal passive cf. 14 ξ 16.
ξ 16. at hercule, ‘on the other hand'; cf. 4 ξ 12. This is
probably a recollection of Demosthenes

an earnest of further success
§19. vel . . . vel: not the same as aut . . . aut; cf. 4 ξ 10.

CHAPTER XIX

§2 lustris: the censors (and before them the consuls) every
five years took a census of the people, and before laying down their
office performed certain rites of purification for them. It is notice-
able that Livy had access to the tabulae censoriae of that time,
though he does not record the figures each lustrum 3 cf. Introd. p. 7.
