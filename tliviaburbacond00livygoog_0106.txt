AB VRBE CONDITA LIB. IX. 19, 20

ipso: i. e. Alexander the Great. sua: i. e. sorte bellorum
suorum, abbreviated for elegance.

§12. primo: 265—241 B.C. certatum: i. e. a Romanis
esse. suffecturam: representing after reor an independent

sufficz‘sset3 cf. 4 ξ 6.

§ 13. foederibus vetustis: this is probably historically true.
adversus . . . hostem duas . . . urbis armaret: together.
The verb giges the sense ‘ would have been likely’ or ‘certain to
arm’3 cf. 2 5.

§ 14. quidem, ‘it is true ’ : sc. experti sunt Romam· Macedonem
hostem. Antiochum: King of Syria, fought Rome, 197 Β. c.
Philippum: King of Macedon. Persen: PerseuS, last king
of Macedon, succeeded Philip, 178 Β. 0., was defeated at Pydna,
168 Β. (3., and lost his throne. non modo . . . sed ne . . .
quidem: in a negative sentence, where the verb is common to
both partS, non modo constantly is used for the logical non modo
non.

ξ 15. absit invidia verbo: since the words that follow sound
boastful. sileant, ‘not arise‚’ since they might so weaken
Rome as to refute the soundness of Livy’s generalization, especially
in view of Crassus’ defeat by the Parthians, 5 3 Β. (3., and of Antony’s
in 36 Β. c., during the period of the Civil WarS. utique, ‘ and
certainly.' nostris: when the ground favoured us. labora-
vimus replaces victi sumus, leaving ab equite, &c., without
a roper construction.

ξ 16. equitem sagittas ε cf. § 7 ; an allusion to the Parthians.

17. civilis . . . concordiae: together.

§2. ab . . . populis . . . legati: an adjectival phrase, quali-
fying a noun like the Greek use with the article, in e. g. οἱ ἐν τῇ

πόλει. frequentibus, ‘ many, one after another.’
4. et = etiam τ a use probably influenced by that of καί in Greek.
5. praefecti: one probably was sent yearly. Capuam:
a natural, but not strictly logical or grammatical construction.
The praefectus was appointed (creari) and sent thither. coepti:
the passive is usual when a passive infinitive follows. legi-
bus . . . datis: when allies, were governed in this way their

local laws were revised and assimilated to Roman law before being
continued. Not very dissimilar is our treatment of Indian law.
utrumque: the sending of a praefectus, and the codification of
laws. aegris rebus: the dative here instead of a genitive
follows remedio ; cf. 40 ᾗ 3 pectori tegumentum.

6. tribus: this addition raised the number to thirty-one.

7. Teates: the same people as the Teanenses above. Livy
