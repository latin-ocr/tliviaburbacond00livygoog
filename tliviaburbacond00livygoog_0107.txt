AB VRBE CONDITA ΜΒ. IX. 20—2

working with two authorities, who used different forms of the
name, has made two embassies out of one. petitum: not
the passive participle. praestandae populo: together.

§8. id . . . impetravere: explained by ut . . . aequo
foedere: an instrumental (ablative) of manner or attendant
circumstances.

ξ 9. Apulia perdomita: together. perrectum: for this
im ersonal passive use cf. itur (= they go) in antiquam silvam.

ξ 10. disciplina, ‘institutionS, political arrangement5‚ consti-
tution.' agere, ‘live.’ - ipsius: instead of a praqfectus
and a praetor who had no connexion with the place, as had been
the case with Capua (§ 5 above), the patroni of Antium itself were

commissioned to the work. patroni: prominent Romam,
whom a place abroad invited to undertake the duty of watching its
interests at Rome. nec = et . . . non.

CHAPTER XXI

ξ 1. creatis: returned as elected. The construction is not
ablative absolute.

ξ 3. hinc . . . hinc: in opposition. Samnis: the singular
is often used for variety, one individual being spoken of as repre-
senting the nation. coacto: not ‘ compelled ’ here.

§4 inde: of time, as in 20 ξ 1. alieni: i. e. Samnite
and besieged, each from other. suis: the order gives the
emphasis needed by the contrast. iusto proelio, ‘ a regular,
pitched battle.' mox: in Livy of succession in past time3
cf. Introd. p. 11. anceps: referring to duplex terror3 so
diversa below. tutam, ‘protected, secured,’ to be distin-

perfect would seem natural. diversa: facing different ways,
to meet both enemies ’

§ 5. tamen: though he fought both enemies at once. nec

§6. varia, ‘partial': i. e. in one part of the line and not in

another. fusi in caetra: together.
CHAPTER XXII
§L deinceps ab dictatore: not by consuIS. ad Sati-

culam : the preposition inserted gives the sense ‘ to the neighbour-
hood of, to the lines round, to beneath the walls of '.

§2. neque enim: the reason for Fabius' coming cum supple-
menta. In this combination the -que is constantly indistinguishable
if enim is given its full sense (ι For . . . not ²). Sometimes it-is
like ‘ strangely enough ' in English. lacessentes: nominative.

ξ 3. e0, ‘on that account': a construction somewhat carelessly
repeated at the beginning of ξ 4. intentius . . . in (moenia)

. . versus, ‘devoting his attention more to.’ (id) tantum
