NOTES

CHAPTER 1

ξ 1. nobilis: not noble. Calvino . . . Postumio: asyndeton
is regular in this formula for dating a year. Otherwise it is usually
found between clauses, not words3 cf. ξ 11. oonsulibus:
i. e. gudae. from 1 July‚ since the consuls entered on their office
ont at a .

ξ 2. longe shows that the superlative implies comparison (‘ most ⁹,
i. e. of all the Samnites, not ‘ very ⁹), as does primum.

ξ 3. dedendas res (see Introd. p. 13) τ the complementary
phrase to res repetere, the first formality used amongst the Italian
peoples before declaring war. ne . . . censeatis: i. e. ‘ I tell you
“ expiatum est '’, ne . . .’ In other words the purpose is the purpose
of the statement, not of the atonement. foedere: of 323 Β. C.
quidquid . . . irarum . . . caelestium: together.

§4 cordi: a predicative dative. fuit: the syntax rules
given in our Latin grammars from observance of Ciceronian usage
would here require a subJunctive, since the clause is suboblique
after scio: so fuerant below. repetitae: by the fetials, who
acted as the heralds or spokesmen of the Roman state, and who
were headed bya pater patratus, who, for purposes of treatieS, warS,
and the like, was to the state what the father was to the family.
So at Cambridge each College has a ‘father ', who presents men to
the Vice—Chancellor for admission to degreeS.

ξς. ultra. . . . quam: together. ι
ἑὸ. perfunctos iam fato: i. e. their bodies were handed over.

So Thomas Becket's remain‘s were condemned for treason three
hundred years after his death, and were visited, as far as possible,
with the proper punishment. quid . . . noxae: together.
§7. Romane: an imaginary individual apostrophized as the
representative of all. arbitris: witness-es rather than judges
or amplat, since in origin the word = ἕθεν to (ar = ad, bit =
βαίνειν). tibi . . . feram: an ethic dative 3 ‘ Shall 1 get, pray? ’
The verb is probably a deliberative subjunctive. neminem . . .
populum . . . privatum: Cicero writes nemo not nullus with
· nouns which express persons; e. g. nemo puer, but nullus liber.
neque: Latin, like Greek, constantly uses a new negative where in a
negative sentence after a general or wide word a subdivision is

made into partS.
§8. quod si: an adverbial accusative has become a conjunction
