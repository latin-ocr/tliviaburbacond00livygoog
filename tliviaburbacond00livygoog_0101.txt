sin lar.

§gi—¹0. quaestione, ‘ inquiry ’ ; almost technical, cf. quaestio per-
petua. quos: for the antecedent omitted cf. 15 ξ 3 and below
scribunt, qui.

ξ 11. inde: presumably if Cursor was not consul then, he was
in his namesake’s arm . ad triumphum: on 21 August
(of the Roman calendar 3²0 Β. C. decessisse: technical, of
a commander leaving his province to come home. auctores
sunt takes the construction that might follow scribunt.

ᾗ 12. et, ‘ and in fact' ; we might use ‘ He was a man indeed ².

§f13. eundem,‚ as often to an English mind, merely connects,
asi = ‘and also .

§ 14. cum, ‘ under the command of 't cf. 13 ξ 6. ullo: the
regular ablative from quisquam 3 cf. 2 ξ 10.

ξιξ.. etiam introduces a fact confirmatory of the last state-
ment; cf. et just above.

ξ 16. ille . . . inquit: Livy not unnaturally finds it convenient
to drop the construction after serunt, and to adopt direct speech
again. utique, ‘at any rate, at least.' dorsum: i. e. of
the horses. vis . . . imperii ingens . . . in, ‘ a commanding
influence over!-

vertisset: the apodosis is contained in parem . . . ducem, which
= ‘as the man who would have been '. In Greek, which has
a participle of εἶμί (= sum) and which can attach ὅν to a participle,
this sense can be tersely expressed by ἂν ὄντα. Latin writers o'f
this date wished to secure an equally terse form of expression in
their own language, and resorted to the turn used here by Livy.

CHAPTER XVII

ξ 1. quaesitum, sc. ‘by me ’. No one could think Livy had so
far travelled outside his subject. The history of Rome was in itself
interesting enough and full enough of chequered episodes and
dramatic sceneS, to need no interludeS. plus iusto, ‘un-
necessan’ly.’ varietatibus, ‘ digressions.’ et legentibus . . .
et . . . meo: observe the chiasmuS.

ξ 2. quibus . . . volutavi animum: English (and Latin gene-
