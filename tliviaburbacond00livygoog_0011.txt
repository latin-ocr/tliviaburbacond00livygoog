PLAN OF THE WORK 7

ξ 3. PLAN OF THE WORK.

The name given by Livy himself to his work indicates the
models he had partially in view. The pontifices had kept from
very early times annales, plain records of the facts connected
with each year that passed—the names of magistrateS, the
occurrence of prodigieS‚ the breaking out or conclusion of war.
Livy, like a true Roman, adopted such a framework for his
history. While he tells each incident with all the realism and
picturesqueness he can command, the skeleton of the whole
is still a bare list of dated eventS. To judge him from any

other point of view is as unfair as to ignore the similar skeleton
in the Hebrew Books of tlte ffl‘ngs.

§ 4. POLITICAL COMPLEXION oF THE WoRK.

Although the district north of the Po received the Roman
franchise through the determination of Caesar in 49 B.c.,
Patavium sided with Pompey, and Livy, like others after him,
whose fathers owed to Caesar or his successors their elevation
from the rank of provinciaIS, sympathized with the oligarchic
side in the history of the past. The plebeian struggle for
recognition he darkened by shading it with touches taken from
the character and conduct of such men as Catiline and Clodius 3
and, in painting the times of the Civil War, he held the balance
at least so scrupulously without favour to Caesar, that Augustus
in jest called him ‘the Pompeian '. This bias may conceivably
have originated in part from the partiality of the authorities
upon whom he drew: Livy had no very deep political philo-

sophy upon which to build a critical recombination of earlier
historianS.

From some admissions of Livy himself it is clear that his
history is altogether of the study and the arm-chair. He did
not go out personally to examine the sites of battle-fields or
