AB VRBE CONDITA LIB. IX. 6

frequency3 Introd. p. 11. indignitate rerum = an English
abstract noun ; cf. 4 ξ 1. res = their ‘treatment' ; cf. Introd. p. 13.

ξ 3. traducti . . . evasissent: English would use short sentences,
not a period, here3 Introd. p. 14. tristior, ‘bitter,’ ‘miserable.’

§4 incerti . . . et quod: for the change of construction
cf. Introd. p. 12. corpora, ‘ themselves!

ξ 5. sociorum: the Romans-3 campanis: the Capuans. They
felt that the Romans were only superior barbarIans. For Livy’s
patriotic interpretation of their feeling cf. Introd. p. 6.

ξ 6. sua: closely with consulibus3 cf. 4 ξ 4. Their paludamenta
are intended. benigne, ‘lavishly,’ )( maligne3 cf. sub luce
maligna (‘ scanty ³). .

§7. cunctus: in Cicero and earlier Latin used only in the
plural (originally coniuncti). iustis ε a noun here. officiis,
‘courtesies ·

ξ 8. neque: an English mind thinks it logical to say ‘Yet . . .
not’3 a Roman felt that this was an additional symptom of the
soldiers’ despair. The negative as usual is thrown sorward‚ the
more 30, since otherwise, unless immediately before poterant, it
would give the sense ‘it was possible that they should not ', ‘ they
might not'. ne . . . quidem: the negative is logically
redundant 'after neque. For English, non modo . . . sedne . . . quidem
must be caresully turned, with due regard to the way in which
neque is translated. The force of the ne . . . quidem extends in
emphasis to the whole clause ut . . . intuerentur, but, again in
spite of logie, Livy is content to enclose between them one or two
notable words of the clause. . eontra, ‘in the face!

§9. adeo: a favourite turn in Livy at the conclusion of some
episode, to give a reflection; ‘so true was it that,' ‘to such an
extent,’ ‘ so completely, utterly.’ pudor quidam, ‘a species
of shame,’ ‘a feeling of disgrace,' ‘their sense of honour however
fantastical,’ ‘a superfine sensitiveneSS.’

§10. oum: since the principal clause is many lines on, the

sentence should be broken up ; Introd. p. 14. a Capua ε the
preposition is inserted when the sense is ‘from the authorities οἷ’,
almost ‘ by’ ; cf. 2 ξ 2, 9 ξ 12. finem: Livy uses the singular,

where Caesar and Cicero would have the plura13 cf. Introd. p. 11.
revertissent: notice with the changing sense the change of tense
in referrent and dicerentur below.

ξ 11. natu multo ι if the sentence be read aloud, it will be seen
whether these words go together or not. adeo ε put here in the
young nobles’ indirect speech, with the same sort of sense as § 9 above.

§ 12. illam, ‘the old' (proverbial, well-known, familiar) 3 cf.
‘true British cheers'. reddere . . . potuisse: the present
infinitive (indirect for the present indicative only) could not mean
anything but that, while the nobles spoke, these things were
occurring (as in habere below); hence reddere must not be taken
