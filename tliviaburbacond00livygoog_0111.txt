case of abstract nouns generally with the verb esse, and with no
qualification except at times a single adjective.

ξ 18. etiamquae non possint: sc.facere; we should probably
resort to the word ‘ impossibilities '. me: the asyndeton used·
in strong contrastS.

except parenthetically (= please). negotium, ‘the task’;
sc. quaerendi or quaestiones exercendi (§ 14).

ξ 22. neo diutius . . viguit: generally the negative flies
forward in Latin.

cf. ex incerta, 24 ξ 8. aperiret: virtually suboblique.

ξ 3. eo: to Capua. utrimque ad. hostem via . . . cunctati:
i. e. either side hesitated to approach its enemy.

ξ 5. perieulum ε not ‘danger’ here. eventus eorum:
i. e. levium proeliorum. trahebant z the plural is natural, if
strictly ungrammatical, aster Romanum.

ξ 7. in cornua (divisis): to serve on the two wingS. inten-
tiores . . . starent: without ut, as often. eo vis: cf. ec, §3.
pedite: instrumental‚ with tutam. (Perhaps Livy spelt it pediti.)

ξ 8. consistunt: the number is noticeable, after consulum (not
consules), but it is natural enough. et = etiam. .

ᾗ 9. universis . . . viribus: together, the order emphasizing
the adjective3 cf. ξ 10 universam . . . aciem.

viri. audita . . . visa . . . restituit: cf. ademptus Hector =
the loss of Hector, a use confined in Cicero to the oblique cases.

ξ 14. iam: as often, can best be got in English by using such a
periphrasis as ‘ began to ’. vincere: a historic infinitive.
Maleventum : the city was a Greek colony Μαλόεις. As often, the
accusative was the form the Romans mostly heard (in answer
e. g. to the question ‘Where does this road go to ? '), and wrongly
analysing its Latin form, Maleventum (cf. sparrowgrass for aspara-
gus, crayfish for e'crevzlvse), they altered it, as ill-omened, into
Beneventum. ad triginta . . . caesa: the verb agrees with
milia, although this is qualified by ad triginta.
