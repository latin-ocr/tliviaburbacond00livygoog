AB VRBE CONDITA LIB. IX. 10, 11

serve. eodem: as had just been disgraced at Caudium.
milite: for the singular cf. Samnite, ξ 5. ad Caudium:
for the preposition inserted cf. 2 ξ 2.

§7. tergum: English would use the plura13 cf. animi, 7 ξ 3,
and pro magistratu, 7 ξ 12. iusta, ‘properly.’

§9. quandoque: used only in formulae. hisee: archaic. .
populi Romani Quiritium: cf. legatum fetialem, ξ 10 below.
quo: final, usually found with comparativeS. sit solutus:

little different from solvatur.

ξ 10. quanta . . . vi: cf. quam (potest) occultissime, 2 § 1.
legatum fetialem: together, in apposition. eo, ‘by that
amount, on that account, therefore!

CHAPTER XI

1. habebunt, ‘ will regard it as.’
2. omnia irrita facie: treat the compact as void, without
going through any mummery.

ξ 3. eum qua potes fide, ‘ as honourably and loyally as possible!
quem si . . . paenitet, restituat == qui, si eum . . . paen„ resti-
tuat.

ξ 4. deceperit, ‘ let both sides be honest ’ς cf. 9 ξ 9. pridie . . .
quam: as if priore die quam. For the locative (of time) cf. also
postridie. tum: but not in this dishonest sashion.

6. defiet: archaiC, where Cicero used the active deficiet.
7. aliquam, ‘ some or other‚' in accordance with its origin
from alius quz'S.

ξ 8. non probat . . . paoem sibi habeat: a vigorous turn for
‘if . . . not . . ., then let . . .'. In sense we can hear after the
first clause ‘ well and good 3 but . . .’. fide, ‘promise.’
erat: where English would use more naturally a subjunctive3
cf. dzffioe’lefuit, 9 ξ 12. ’

§ 9. ut: explanatory of hoc below. quidem emphasizes the
clause (= ‘indeed ³), with an almost ironical effect (‘ forsooth ⁹).
ego: for the asyndeton cf. 1 ᾗ 1. iuris gentibus: the genitive
is partitive or descriptive; ‘as consistent with, as your interpre-
tation of ’3 cf. 19 § 5. The dative depends upon iuris probably,
thus avoiding a string of genitiveS‚ but dicitis doubtless makes its
use easier. Cf. in English ‘the cost of ' and ‘the charge for '.

§10. ego vero, ‘No ,Ι I . . .’. istosi, ‘these with you.’
moror: transitive with the sense of impedio, ,

ξ 11. ita: after this pretence no doubt—ironical. factum
esse: still after di credent.

ξ 12. pudere: exclamatory infinstive, as in mene mathemalicls
semper servire magtlrtris ,Ι fallendae fidei‘: probably dative ;
cf. gentibus, § 9, and 2 § 15 ; but it is hard sometimes to distinguish
whether a Roman would have felt he was using a genitive or

dative.
