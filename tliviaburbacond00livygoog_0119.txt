comitia centuriata and tributa arose and held the reality of power,
the formal vesting with imperium of those by them elected was done
by the ancient patrician comitia cun‘ata. principium: in the
various curiae the votes were taken simultaneously3 then the order
in which the results from the several curiae should be announced
was determined by lot, that which came first being called prin-
cipium. ‘eiusdem euriae fuerat: in 390 and in 321 B. c. this
curia had been drawn first, when the lex curiata was to be passed
sor the various magistrates of those yearS.

moner than the imperfect even in Cicero, when the clause is

affirmative clause. It is believed to be an attempt to represent
the Greek ὥστε with an aorist infinitive.
