6 ’ INTRODUCTION

Ovid, January 1, 18 A. D.‚ leaving still unwri'tten the story of
the preceding 26 yearS.

ξ 2. Mo‘mvEs or· THE WORK.

Besides the inward impulse which urges the historiari to
write history, as the poet to write poetry, it is possible to infer
special reasons from outside which led Livy to his task. The
previous half-century had produced an extraordinary increase
in wealth at Rome, and at the same time a terrible passion in
men and women of pleasure to gather wealth from every
quarter and by every meanS, while an equally terrible passion
to squander and waste it in momentary and capricious pleasures
affected the same section of society. Pompey's conquests in
the East and Caesar's in the West, with the opening of the
Egyptian treasure-houseS, had turned the heads and hearts of
men more disastrously than the discovery of America turned the
Elizabethans’. This wave of frivolity and rapacity was largely
spent by the time the Civil Wars had swept away many of the
more dashing figures or left them stripped of their property.
A reflux of sentiment set in from the healthy country towns
and the sober members of the community. Augustus himself,
though not free from the tainting influence of the society in‘
which his youth was spent, warmly seconded the reformation‚
and its success was assured when VirgiI, Horace, and Livy all
alike gave their powers to further it. The historian then, in
part at least, aimed at Setting before his contemporaries, with
all the attractiveness that imagination and a charming style
could lend, the example of their forefatherS, their glorious self-
sacrifice sor their country, and the providential guidance of
her destinies. Not very dissimilarly the sons of the prophets
wrote the history of the Hebrew kingdomS, not primarily to
record historic factS, but-to trace the Divine development os
eventS, the punishment of the sinful, the success of the God-
fearing.
