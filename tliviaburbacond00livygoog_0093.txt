may be used == ὅμως no less than μέντοι; cf. the use of at below, §8.
Thus qua = sed ea. Latin writers, however, have examples of
a construction like that used by Addison and some loose writers
to-day: e. g. ‘1 have witnessed similar phenomena, and which
I wssl explain '. ex ea: under the contract. debentur: the
number is affected illogically ,but naturally by corpora, which
is nearer than the subject3 cf. by way of contrast‚ ‘ I've found him
to be one of those men (= the sort of man) who doesn't hesitate to
break liis word, tf there ’s something to gain by it.’

§7. placet, ‘ J move, propone? neo, ‘ but not’3 cf. 7 § 9.

ξ 8. quaeso: an archaic use3 Ciceronian Latin hardly used it
except parenthetically (= please). fuit ε the sentence is con-
structed so as not to depend on precor quaesoque, otherwise the
mood would be different. at, ‘ yet,' begins the apodosis, after
the if-clauses; cf. 1 ἕ 8.

§ 9. habeatis: optative, like velitis below. videre: this
is still to come. capitibus ι instrumental 3 cf. 3 ξ 4.

§ 15. pro eo, quod: together. meritos esse . . . posse:
observe the difference in sense expressed by the tense.

CHAPTER IX

ξ 1. dedetis, ‘you shall . . .,' perhaps as often with a jussive
sense. et = etiam3 cf. 2 4. istos: often with some
contempt or dislike; cf. istam, 5 below.

ξ 2. audiatis: the future would have brought the flogging into
line with the surrender, as equally certain future events; the
change of mood makes the flogging a possible addition only ; so
dedantur. iam, ‘ at once,’ ‘ immediately ’ ; cis. the use of ἤδη.
