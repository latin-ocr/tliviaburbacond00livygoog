it the plebeians secured some further recognition—after 366 ac.
one consul was of necessity always a plebeian,—and the extension
of Roman power was continued by the dissolution of the Latin
League in 338 Β. C„ the members becoming henceforth rather
humble dependants of Rome than equal allieS‚ and by the
conquest of Campania. The practice begun in 450 Β. e. of
throwing colonies into disaffected districts riveted the links
of Roman dominion firmly together. But ‘the Romans'
intrusion into Campania naturally disturbed the Samnites ², and
from 326-304 Β. e. the struggle for the empire of Italy raged
incessantly. Rome wished to secure Palaeopolis and Neapolis,
in order to complete her reduction of Campania. The
Samnites garrisoned Palaeopolis, and the Romans accepted
this gage of battle. Presently the besieged town was induced
to throw over their Samnite helpers and to join Rome, and the
Lucaniam, won to the Roman alliance‚ prevented Tarentum
from assisting their Samnite friends, Thus the Samnites were
isolated, were unable to support unaided the shock of the
Roman armS, and begged for peace. This was refused 3²1 Β. c.,
and the sequel is told in Livy's N inth Book.
