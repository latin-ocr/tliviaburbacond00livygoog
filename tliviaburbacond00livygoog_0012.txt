to decipher 'venerable inscriptions, He drew from earlier
writers who had used such primary evidence. Of such writers
there were first a succession of bare chroniclers like Q. Fabius
Pictor, a faithful recorder of earlier evidence, who lived in the
time of Hannibal3 L. Cincius AlimentUS, an honest and
critical writer of the same date 3 and L. Calpurnius Piso Frugi
CensorinuS, whose rationalistic treatment of early traditions
made a revolution in the Roman study of history. Most‘

To-day a very different conception prevails as to the functions
and duties of historians from what prevailed even a hundred

study of the past. But before this conception became thus pre-
dominant, a change had taken place from the ancient position.
Forty years ago Professor Seeley distinguished three duties of
the historian : two scientific in nature, viz. first to investigate
factS, secondly to deduce from them principles 3 and a third,
literary in nature, to arrange and record the results in stately
