AB VRBE CONDITA LIB. IX. 19

Umbria, and the Gauls; (2) the south-east, i. e. Samnium and
Lucania. in Etruria, in Vmbria: for the asyndeton see
1 1.

ξξ4. Latium . . . invenisset (sc, Alexander): together. The
sentence is a good instance of Livy's power to avoid monotony
by variety of expression. We may say that que unites words
closely so as to make them express one composite conception 3 et

unites them in a level catalogue ; ac or atque (= ‘and also ⁹) lays “

emphasis on the following word. adiuncta omni ora Grae· Α
eorum: cf. ξ 2 in omni. The ancients’ grasp of geography was
less secure than ours (cf. Introd. p. 7 stt), and Livy speaks of the
whole stretch of coast where Greeks were to be found as if it
fringed one sea, which is hardly true when that sea is not called
the Mediterranean but inseri (cf. 2 ᾗ 6 superi maris). a 'I'huriis :
to be explained by the fact that the town is really the name of its
inhabitants ς cf. the old ‘ Bishop of the Sumersaetan ’, now of Bath
and Wells. Antio . . . tenus: together. The original use
(an adverbial accusative of extent = ‘the stretch ’ or ‘ reach of ')
with a genitive or with an ablative of the point from which the
measurement starts has quite developed into a prepositional use.
Ostiis: generally the smgular form is found. Livy perhaps
chooses this sor variety ; cf. Neapolim et Cumas, where the selection
of places named may be determined by the same consideration.
aut socios validos . . . aut tractos . . . hostes: chiasmuS.

§ 5. hominum == peditum. hoo roboris (partitive gen.
11 ξ 9) erat (se. ei): belonged to, constituted, the flower of his
troops, maius: not magis. traheret: i. e. with him. The
im erfect = ‘in that case he would have been dragging' 3 cf. 17 § 16.

6. adde quod: a poetical turn for ‘moreover’. esset:
potential subjunctive like traheret above ; so consenuisset. Boma-
nis . . . Alexandro: see § 3. quod = id quod. agro
bellanti: not together.

§·7. ictu missuque: a hendiadyS, two ways of regarding the
hurlin)g of the pilum (which is not used for thrusting like the
sarisa .

ξ 8. partibus: (1) in lines hastati, principes, triarii; (2) longi-
tudinally, maniples. partienti: if the general wished to sub-
divide his sorces; cf. 17 § 4. esset : an imitation of the Greek
optative, for which Cicero would have used the indicative3 cf. 6§ 2.

ξ 9. iam, ‘ again, finally.’ opere: the Romans knew that the
trenching spade was perhaps even more important than the sword;
cf. 2 ξ 12. Cannae: where Hannibal, 216 B. C., defeated
Aemilius Paulus and Terentius Varro· ·

§10. ne: like ναί. saepe . . . quaesisset: used here
like requiro of ‘sighing for’, ‘regretting’. fuisse: before
coming to Italy; otherwise esse3 cf. 7.

§11. sortem, ‘circumstances, con ition5‚ chances. hoo
