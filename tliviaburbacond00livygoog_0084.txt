AB VRBE CONDITA LIB. IX. 1, 2

(ε but), its origin forgotten. It is chiefly used before sz'. oum
(potentiore iuris), ‘in dealing with,’ ‘as against.' at, like
tamen, introduces here the principal clause.

§ 9. uatis sint: the subjunctive is due both to the force of (eos)
quibus (= such men as) and to the preceding subjunctive.
domini: the singular of each owner; cf. Romane (§7). placari:
thrown forward for emphasis, an arrangement Livy likes 3 cf. 4 § 9.
viscera, 6 flesh’.

10. quibus: sc. eis, as its antecedent.

11. quam propitiis: sc. ‘ dis agant homines' (from ‘rerum
humanarum ’ = 6 rerum hominum ’), the whole clause being, with the
next (‘quam adversis . . . dis ’), the subject to ⁴(momentum) sit’.
magis: i. e. it would be truer to say. gessisse: Livy omits
the subject, as writers of Greek do. ducibus ipsis dis:
ablative absolute.

CHAPTER 11

§L non . . . magi· quam, 6 as . . . as.⁹ quam potest
ogeultissime: the full form, with historic present, of the familiar

rase.

p ξ 2. ad Calatiam : the pre osition is inserted to express ‘to the
neighbourhood of ⁹, ‘ to beneatss the walls of ’‚ 6 to the lines round '.
iam . . . esse: together.

ξ 3. inciderint: the indirect form (perfect subj.) of the future perf. -
indic. which would be the direct speech. Here Livy gives primary
sequence throughout after the historic present iubet. ut . . .
constet: after the first clause, immediately depending on iubet,
Livy for clearness falls back on this form for an indirect command.
Another infinitive would have read like a statement, and that con-
struction is actually needed, to follow idem sermo. abe-se:
Probably legiotges is still the subject 3 contrast with this nec multum
a uit uin, 22 . 9.

s§ ψῃ et ante : Cicero uses etiam ; Livy follows the poets’ use, itself
perhaps copied from the Greek use of καί. captivi: the cap-
tured soldierS, make-believe shepherdS.

ξ 5. Romanus: cf. 1 § 7. ferret has a future sense ;
the direct form would be sert (= ‘is instantly about to take ’). Cicero
would mean something else (‘ was taking ') by this construction, ancl
would use for Livy's sense laturus esset. In conditional clauses, os
course, the present subj. in Oratio Obliqua or imperfect regularly

represents the future indicative of the Oratio Recta. simul : a
second motive, besides the loyalty of Luceria. ad, ‘in face
of‚’ ‘in view of! effi. modo . . . irent: indirect form (in

historic sequence) of the deliberate subjunctive.

ξ 6. superi marin: the Adriatic (cf. 19 ξ 4 infieri maris).
tanto fere: the additional sasety was practz’cally counterbalanced
by the additional length.
