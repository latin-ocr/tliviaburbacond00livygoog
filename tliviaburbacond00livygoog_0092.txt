regularly using the singular in such cases; e. g. for‘ they spent
their li',ves vitam agebant. expressum . . . est: sc. ‘out
of them' ; cf. 9 ξ 5. comitiorum eausa· . to hold the
elections of the next year’ s magistrates.

§14 vitio, ‘irregularly,' the smallest mistake or oversight in
the formalities of appointment invalidating it from a strictly
technical point of view. For the sociative case cf. 9 7. neo:
the knowledge of the uses in Greek of οὐδέ affecte later Latin
writers’ use of nec, which they made do the work of ne. ,quidem· ,
cf.Introd.p.1ad interregnum rediit: a constitutional
survival from the times of the monarchy, when, unlike the modern
English rule that a new king succeeds at the moment of another's
death, the theory and practice was that the royal powers became
vested in the whole body of patres, who acted by an interrex. He
held office for five days, and under the Republic he nominated a
successor who nominated the dictator, under whose presidency
the new consuls were elected. So the English use was for the
witan to elect a new king; and even now on a bishop's death the
dFan and chapter of the cathedral city administer the spiritualities
o the see.

ξ 15. creavit: he proposed the names, held the election, and
declared the result. nulli: the plural for the sense ‘ no other
pair '. tempestate: an archaic use, found also in Sallust
= tempore. essent: of the people’s feeling3 cf. 5 ξ 6.

age when they were the heads of citizen families. consultis:
e. g. sanctioning a levy and assigning the consuls’ spheres of duty
(provincme). rettulerunt, ‘ introduced the questz'on,’ ‘ brought
the matter before the senate?

§ 2. penes quem: each consul in turn was supreme, when both
were in Rome or elsewhere at the same time. The elder-Publilius
here-had the first turn. The presiding consul called on senators
to express their views; generally he called first on consuls designate,
then on past consuls, and so through their various rankS‚ but
inside each grade making what order he pleased of individualS.
Here one of the last consuls is first called on.

ἕ 3. ignominiae, non honoris: cf. 1 ξ 1 for the asyndeton.
excitatum iussumque: cf. Introd. p. 12 for the omission of the
copulative verb. qua . . .qua· 3 ξ 4; cf. cum . ...cum

4 esset. i. e. if Ι had to make it; cf. 5 § 3. paucis· .
sc. verbzs. mihine an legionibus: an alternative: ‘ whether
τί was J or . . . whom?

ξ 5. qua tamen τ the antecedent is sponsione, but the insertion
of tamen does not show that the relative clause ranks as quite
parallel to the preceding adjectives turpi and necessan'a, for tamen
