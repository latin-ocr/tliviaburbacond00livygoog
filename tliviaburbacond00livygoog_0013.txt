history should hand down truth.’ The great Roman literary
critic Quintilian at the end of the first century A.D. declared

poem. It is designed to relate a story, not to establish
a theory ’.1 He therefore commends in Livy his lactea ubertas
(i. e. his ample style which yet is pure, simple, and clear, not
full of mere empty words), while pointing out that this will not
meet the requirements of one who desires not beauty of narra-

ment of his meritS, but as a means to call his attention to sides
os his work that need consideration two or three criticisms may
be quoted. Dr. Arnold wrote: ‘ As to Livy, the use of reading
