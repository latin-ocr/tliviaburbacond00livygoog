AB VRBE CONDITA LIB. IX. 23—5

ξ 14. vadunt: always of rapid movement; 13 ξ 2. proxi-
mis tantum: which alone would be visible.

ξ 15. in tempore, ‘ at the proper moment.’ qui: sc. via.
per diversa, ‘in every direction.’

§ 16. turba: ‘ its disorder’. in medio: between the two

Roman armies.
ξ 17. quorum praeda. onustum militem: together. For the

C HAPTER XXIV

1. reditum: se. est.

ἐκ neo . . . et: cf. οὔτε . . . ve: and 4 ξ 8. tempore
longinqua . .. . praeceps periculo: the language is rather
strained for conciseness and point. With a long siege victory was
distant ; a storm would be quicker, but dangerous and rash. The
chiasmus is to be noticed.

§ 4. inde . . . perpulit: cf. 21 §4 for the temporal use of the par-
ticle. ut. by its position makes the grouping of the other words
clear, dividing the attributes of the subject from the predicate.

ξ 5. fore : for the change of construction due to the passing into
oblique statement after oblique request cf. 2 § 3. ardua, ‘ steep
ground, path.' pluribus . . . conlatis: see -Introd. pp. 11 and 14.

6. ad hoc, ‘ besides (this).'
7. vel tree, ‘ three if you like, even three’ 3 cf. 4 ᾗ 10.
arcuerint: a potential perfect subjunctive; cf. dixerit quis.

§8. quae omnia: not together. ex incerto, ‘in conse-
quence of the dimneSS, the obscurity ἐ a use of the neuter adjective
something like the Greek, equivalent to an abstract noun.

§9. pro vestram fidem, ‘help, help ’ς look out pro (not the
preposition) and fides: cf. 12 ξ 8.

ᾗ 10. incidens . . . foribus: together.

ᾖ 1 1. pavorem, ‘ the alarm.' tela et. armatos tenere: an
intelligible but illogical turn. multiplicato numero: the
scouts exaggerated.

12. praesidium: the cohorts of ξ 5 above.
13. reliquos (ex . . . )feeerat: together.

ἢ 14. infandae, ‘ abominable‚ atrociou5.’

ξ 15. ouius . . . intererat: this construction was developed
under the influence of the almost synonymous refert. The reader
should turn to 9 § 7 for an account of the construction following
refert, and should observe that with interest the construction
cannot be rigorously analysed and construed.

C HAPTER XXV

ξ 3. inquirendo: an instrumental or sociative (ablative), of
attendant circumstances = ‘in the course of'; cf. 3 § 11 per-
cunctando exsequerentur.
