AB VRBE CONDITA LIB. IX. 2, 3

ξ 7. saltum ‘passeS,' ‘ defiles.² eirea : Livy frequently puts
an adverb between a noun ancl an agreeing adjective, and makes it
express another adjective meaning. The use is like that in Greek
of an adverb with the article to give an adjectival sense. Here the
sense is ‘ which lay around ’. satis, ‘ fairly,’ ‘ rather!

§ 8. antequam venias: the subjunctive, to give the prospective
sense, ‘ before the traveller can come.’ The second person in Latin
of an imagined character is not familiar, as the corresponding use
is in English. Older English writers use ‘ a man ’ for ‘ one '.
eadem, like qud here and in ξ 5, is in ,use an adverb, in origin a
pronoun agreeing with via understood. insinuaveris: Latin
uses this precise tense, where English uses a present or aorist.
pergas: the subjunctive makes this alternative the vaguer and less

prgbgblpia alia: opposed to the following alias angustias.
in eum eampum . . . demi-so: together.
ξ 10. sua: as the pass in front also had its obex. ullius:

used as the genitive of quisquam ; so ulle, ξ 13.

11. magis: than himself.

12. operi: i. e. of sortifying a camp (muniendi); cf. 19 §9.
fore : for the subject omitted see 1 ξ 11.

§ 13. eulpam: of their own )( the doing of fortune. propter:
with its poetical meaning, of position.

14. confessione: se. that it was vain.

15. eonsilium: aCouncilofWar. con-ilio . . . loeus:
there was no possibility of planning any deliverance‚ no way of
escape could possibly be thought of. esset: by the mood
used Livy gives the sense that this was in the consuls' thoughts,
For this vz‘rtually suboblique use cf. 5 ξ 6. legati, ‘ com-
manders of divisions.’ tribuni: se. militum. praetorium ε
one of the two praetoria of ξ 12, in which the council was held.
poterant: as usual with this auxiliary verb the indicative is used
where we should have thought the writer might use the subjunctive.
(That mood Livy avoids, since it would have suggested the same
sense as we have in esset, just above.) The sense is ‘would have

been able ’.
CHAPTER 111

ξ 1. pro ingenio quisque: some temperaments being melan-

choly and despondent, some sanguine. adversa montium:
a poetical turn3 cf. strata viarum, opaca iugorum.
ξ 2. modo = dummoda vincimus: the present with iam,

as a Welshman or Irishman says ‘it hasn't rained since you are
here’ (= you have been here). So with iamdudum, iampn‘dem.
perfidum: so perfide Albion, Punica fideS, and the implication
in ‘ Dutch courage .

ξ 3. eamus: a good example of how the deliberative subjunctive
