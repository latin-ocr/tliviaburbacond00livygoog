ξ 8. H1NTs on TRANSLATION.

As has been already hinted, the order of Livy's words is of
great importance to the understanding of his meaning. To
read a sentence aloud——if necessary, several times over—is of
the utmost service for ascertaining this. But, the meaning
once grasped, the student has the task before him of expressing
this in English, smooth and elegant, vigorous and pictorial,
aster the manner of his original. To get some idea of what
he should make his aim he should read widely in Macaulay,
F roude, N apier, Prescott, Creasy, and Kinglake. He should
also study carefully a few paragraphs which may take his fancy
as particularly vigorous in those historians. He should observe
how short sentences and long are interwoven to make a para-
graph, how they are connected, what kind of words are used,
or of those he is osten tempted to use in translating what kind
is avoided. He should then resolve to be dissatisfied with
any translation which does not run as smoothly to his ear and
read as naturally as native English. At the same time he
should be careful not to add or subtract anything from his
author’s statements, nor to tell his story in a more simple and
childlike nor in a more stiff and ornamented way than his
Latin. A few special details which generally cause beginners
difficulty may receive a word of comment.

often=proposal, measure, plan ; and res repeterezto demand
satisfaction, reparation. Three details deserve notice.

(a) In Latin the imperfect occurs as frequently in the
passive as in the active. In English it rarely occurs, Generally

the sentence round so that the active voice of the verb is used,
